**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 5, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when something finally clicks. I was going to start tomorrow, but there was nothing stopping me from doing an hour today. 

**REMINDER** I am learning. It is important to give myself grace and work through things that I do not know.

**REMINDER** Things won't always come easy. Pause, take a breath, and figure it out.

### Day 6: January 13, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a couple of exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Broke my streak for Taco Tuesday, but those $2 margs were worth it. I learned more about colors and I liked it alot. It is absoluely amazing how much thought and time goes into a simple website.  

**REMINDER** It's hump dayyyyyyy. 

### Day 7: January 14, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a couple of exercises on FreeCodeCamp and started Googles Python class.

**Thoughts** I almost didn't code today because I didn't feel like it. Then I learned about the passing of a friend of my friends and that shook me up. So I got up and kept pushing through.    

**REMINDER** Life is fleeting. Enjoy each and every second of it. Be kind to people. 

### Day 8: January 15, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a couple of exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I almost didn't code today because it's Friday and I had a long week. I quickly got over that and did my exercises. I have been using a 20 minutes on and 10 minutes off method to study. So far I like it. It allows me to focus in small increments which is perfect for my attention span.     

**REMINDER** It's friday, friday, gotta get down on friday.
