**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 5, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when something finally clicks. I was going to start tomorrow, but there was nothing stopping me from doing an hour today. 

**REMINDER** I am learning. It is important to give myself grace and work through things that I do not know.

### Day 2: January 7, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a couple of exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Sad that I already missed a day, but America turnt tf up yesterday. I did what I always do in times of crisis, turned to Twitter. 
I did not put forth my best effort today, but I will try my best to do better tomorrow. 

**REMINDER** Things won't always come easy. Pause, take a breath, and figure it out.
