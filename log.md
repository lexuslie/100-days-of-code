**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 5, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when something finally clicks. I was going to start tomorrow, but there was nothing stopping me from doing an hour today. 

**REMINDER** I am learning. It is important to give myself grace and work through things that I do not know.
